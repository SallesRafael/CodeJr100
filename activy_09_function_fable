"""
Write a Python script that defines a function called calculate_area
to calculate the area of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters,
length and width, and return the calculated area. Call the function with different
values for length and width to demonstrate its functionality.
This task assesses your ability to define and use functions in Python.
